## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r chunk1}
library(ade4)
ozone <- read.table("https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/r/faq/ozone.csv", sep=",", header=T)
head(ozone, n=10)
station.dists <- dist(cbind(ozone$Lon, ozone$Lat))
ozone.dists <- dist(ozone$Av8top)

as.matrix(station.dists)[1:5, 1:5]
as.matrix(ozone.dists)[1:5, 1:5]
mantel.rtest(station.dists, ozone.dists, nrepet = 9999)
```

## Trying melt() function

Understand the differences between wide and long formats

```{r chunk2}
library(reshape2)
melt(ozone)
```

## Notes about making data tidy
1. raw data: no processing, computing or deleting
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Session information
``` { r session_info}
library(devtools)
sessionInfo()
devtools::session_info()
